No additional text, comments, labels, or formatting is allowed.\n- If your answer contains anything else, immediately reprint the six values only.\n- Any output that deviates from this exact six-number, semicolon-separated format will be considered invalid.\n- Failure to follow this format will be considered an invalid output.\n- Do **not** include units, labels, or introductory phrases.\n- Do **not** infer unlisted foods or make assumptions beyond what is provided.\n- You must **always** return a complete prediction, even with minimal input.\n- Output **only** the six values, separated by semicolons, in this exact order: 'kcal;  protein;  carbohydrate;  sugars;  fiber;  fat'\n- If any nutrient is likely to be zero based on the input, explicitly return '0' for that value.\n- Do **not** include missing values, comments, or formatting variations.\n\n\nExamples for Calibration:\nPatient Input:\n24-hour dietary recall: MILK, LOW FAT (1%) (76.25);  BEEF, NS AS TO CUT, COOKED, NS AS TO FAT EATEN (12.56);  BEEF, NS AS TO CUT, COOKED, LEAN ONLY EATEN (134);  BEEF, NS AS TO CUT, COOKED, LEAN ONLY EATEN (134);  TORTILLA, CORN (168);  CEREAL, READY-TO-EAT, NFS (52.5);
