The final estimates were rounded to two decimals and formatted as required.\n\nINTERNAL Reasoning:\nChain-of-Thought Reasoning:\n1. **Identify Foods and Portions**  \nParse the list of foods and quantities (in grams/mL), identifying each food type and its contribution to energy and macronutrients.\n2. **Reference Internal Knowledge from NDSR**  \nUse your mental simulation of the NDSR nutrient database to retrieve nutrient values per 100g for each food item, adjusting proportionally based on the reported intake.\n3. **Estimate Nutrient Totals**  \nAccumulate values for each nutrient: total kcal, protein, carbohydrate, sugars, fiber, and fat.\n4. **Format Your Output**  \nRound your final estimates to two decimal places and report them in the exact required order and format.\n\n\nCritical Output Rules:\n- Your output must be exactly six numeric values separated by semicolons. No additional text, comments, labels, or formatting is allowed.\n- If your answer contains anything else, immediately reprint the six values only.\n- Any output that deviates from this exact six-number, semicolon-separated format will be considered invalid.\n- Failure to follow this format will be considered an invalid output.\n- Do **not** include units, labels, or introductory phrases.\n- Do **not** infer unlisted foods or make assumptions beyond what is provided.\n- You must **always** return a complete prediction, even with minimal input.\n- Output **only** the six values, separated by semicolons, in this exact order: 'kcal;  protein;  carbohydrate;  sugars;  fiber;  fat'\n- If any nutrient is likely to be zero based on the input, explicitly return '0' for that value.\n- Do **not** include missing values, comments, or formatting variations.\n\n\nExamples for Calibration:\nPatient Input:\n24-hour dietary recall: MILK, LOW FAT (1%) (76.25);  BEEF, NS AS TO CUT, COOKED, NS AS TO FAT EATEN (12.56);  BEEF, NS AS TO CUT, COOKED, LEAN ONLY EATEN (134);  BEEF, NS AS TO CUT, COOKED, LEAN ONLY EATEN (134);  TORTILLA, CORN (168);  CEREAL, READY-TO-EAT, NFS (52.5);  APPLE JUICE, 100% (325.5);  POTATO, NFS (120);  BROCCOLI, COOKED, FROM FRESH, FAT NOT ADDED IN COOKING (117);  BROCCOLI, COOKED, FROM FRESH, FAT NOT ADDED IN COOKING (117);  CARROTS, COOKED, FROM FRESH, FAT NOT ADDED IN COOKING (117);  SOFT DRINK, FRUIT FLAVORED, CAFFEINE FREE (248)\nExpected Output: 1630;  107.97;  233.28;  79.83;  27.7;  33.68\n\nPatient Input:\n24-hour dietary recall: ICE CREAM, REGULAR, NOT CHOCOLATE (141.31);  CHEESE, NFS (24);  BOLOGNA, NFS (28);  SUNFLOWER SEEDS, HULLED, ROASTED, SALTED (46);  BREAD, WHITE (52);  COOKIE, MARSHMALLOW, W/ RICE CEREAL (NO-BAKE) (60);  MILK 'N CEREAL BAR (24);  PASTA W/ TOMATO SAUCE & MEAT/MEATBALLS, CANNED (280.13);  SOFT DRINK, FRUIT-FLAVORED, CAFFEINE FREE (368)\nExpected Output: 1629;  43.29;  205.67;  113.29;  14.9;  74.29\n\nPatient Input:\n24-hour dietary recall: CHICKEN NUGGETS, FROM FROZEN (96);  CHICKEN TENDERS OR STRIPS, BREADED, FROM SCHOOL LUNCH (80);  BIG MAC (MCDONALDS) (135);  MACARONI OR NOODLES WITH CHEESE, MADE FROM PACKAGED MIX (57.5);  APPLE, RAW (125);  STRAWBERRIES, RAW (108);  POTATO, FRENCH FRIES, FAST FOOD (55);  POTATO, MASHED, FROM SCHOOL LUNCH (62.5);  WATER, BOTTLED, PLAIN (20);  WATER, BOTTLED, PLAIN (345)\nExpected Output: 1293;  48.28;  135.41;  29.22;  13.2;  62.15\n\nPatient Input:\n24-hour dietary recall: MILK, COW'S, FLUID, 2% FAT (259.25);  CHICKEN, THIGH, STEWED, W/ SKIN (88);  BREAD, GARLIC (333);  RICE, WHITE, COOKED, REGULAR, NO FAT ADD IN COOKING (79);  FROSTED FLAKES, KELLOGG'S (74.31);  PIZZA, CHEESE, THIN CRUST (136.78);  PLUM, RAW (66);  GRAPE JUICE (332.06);  FRUIT JUICE DRINK (449.5);  FRUIT JUICE DRINK (449.5)\nExpected Output: 2923;  81.63;  443.26;  206.48;  14.8;  93.63\n\nPatient Input:\n24-hour dietary recall: ICE CREAM CONE, VANILLA, PREPACKAGED (95);  CHICKEN, NS AS TO PART AND COOKING METHOD, SKIN NOT EATEN (75.94);  RICE, WHITE, COOKED, NO ADDED FAT (138.25);  TACO, MEAT, NO CHEESE (180);  CARROTS, RAW (45);  TOMATOES, RAW (67.5);  LETTUCE, RAW (19.69);  SOFT DRINK, COLA (264.5);  SOFT DRINK, COLA (264.5);  WATER, BOTTLED, PLAIN (1740)\nExpected Output: 1338;  57.38;  162.67;  81.11;  8;  51.38\n\nPatient Input:\n24-hour dietary recall: GENERAL TSO CHICKEN (866.88);  WAFFLE, FRUIT (78);  RICE, FRIED, W/ PORK (210.38);  SYRUP,"
