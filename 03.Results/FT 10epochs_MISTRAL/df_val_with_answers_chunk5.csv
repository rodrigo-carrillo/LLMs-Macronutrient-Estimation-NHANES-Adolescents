OUTCOME:
1991; 79.1; 278.01; 136.1; 15.6; 61.01

EXPLANATION:
The six values are estimates calculated by analyzing the patient's dietary intake and referencing an internal simulation of the NDSR nutrient database. The process involved identifying foods, retrieving nutrient values, and accumulating totals for each nutrient.

FORMATTING:
The output is formatted as six numeric values separated by semicolons. Each value is rounded to two decimal places.

INPUTS:
The patient's dietary recall is analyzed to estimate six nutritional values: total kcal, protein, carbohydrate, sugars, fiber, and fat.

OUTPUTS:
The six estimated nutrition values are returned in this format: kcal; protein; carbohydrate; sugars; fiber; fat. Each value is separated by a semicolon and rounded to two decimals.

ERRORS:
If any input is invalid or unrecognized, the output will be six zeros. If the input is recognized but the nutrient value is likely to be zero, the output will explicitly return '0' for that value.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING:
1. Identify Foods and Portions  
Parse the list of foods and quantities (in grams/mL), identifying each food type and its contribution to energy and macronutrients.

2. Reference Internal Knowledge from NDSR  
Use your mental simulation of the NDSR nutrient database to retrieve nutrient values per 100g for each food item, adjusting proportionally based on the reported intake.

3. Estimate Nutrient Totals  
Accumulate values for each nutrient: total kcal, protein, carbohydrate, sugars, fiber, and fat.

4. Format Your Output  
Round your final estimates to two decimal places and report them in the exact required order and format.
Do not explain your reasoning.
Do not repeat or preface the answer.
Output only the final six numbers in this format: kcal; protein; carbohydrate; sugars; fiber; fat.
Do not prefix with ""Assistant:"" or ""Answer:"".
Output the six values ONCE and nothing else. Failure to follow this format will be considered incorrect.
