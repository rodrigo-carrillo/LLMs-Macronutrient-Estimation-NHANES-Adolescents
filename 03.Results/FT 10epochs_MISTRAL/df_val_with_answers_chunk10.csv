### Final Answer:
574; 8.67; 85.81; 34.17; 2.5; 22.11

### Explanation:
The answer is a six-number, semicolon-separated list, in this exact order: 'kcal; protein; carbohydrate; sugars; fiber; fat'
Each value is rounded to two decimals.
The six values are estimates, not exact numbers.
The order and formatting must be exact.
Do not explain your reasoning.
Do not repeat or preface the answer.
Output only the final six numbers in this format: kcal; protein; carbohydrate; sugars; fiber; fat.
Do not prefix with ""Assistant:"" or ""Answer:"".
Output the six values ONCE and nothing else. Failure to follow this format will be considered incorrect.


### User Input:
24-hour dietary recall: SOUP, MOSTLY NOODLES (174.75); POTATO CHIPS, OTHER FLAVORED (21.88); POTATO CHIPS, OTHER FLAVORED (14.06); SOFT DRINK, FRUIT-FLAVORED, CAFFEINE FREE (248); WATER, TAP (195)

### Expected Output:
574; 8.67; 85.81; 34.17; 2.5; 22.11

### Reasoning:
1. **Identify Foods and Portions**  
Parse the list of foods and quantities (in grams/mL), identifying each food type and its contribution to energy and macronutrients.
2. **Reference Internal Knowledge from NDSR**  
Use your mental simulation of the NDSR nutrient database to retrieve nutrient values per 100g for each food item, adjusting proportionally based on the reported intake.
3. **Estimate Nutrient Totals**  
Accumulate values for each nutrient: total kcal, protein, carbohydrate, sugars, fiber, and fat.
4. **Format Your Output**  
Round your final estimates to two decimal places and report them in the exact required order and format.


Critical Output Rules:
- Your output must be exactly six numeric values separated by semicolons. No additional text, comments, labels, or formatting is allowed.
- If your answer contains anything else, immediately reprint the six values only.
- Any output that deviates from this exact six-number, semicolon-separated format will be considered invalid.
- Failure to follow this format will be considered an invalid output.
- Do **not** include units, labels, or introductory phrases.
- Do **not** infer unlisted foods or make assumptions beyond what is provided.
- You must **always** return a complete prediction, even with minimal input.
- Output **only** the six values, separated by semicolons, in this exact order: 'kcal; protein; carbohydrate; sugars; fiber; fat'
- If any nutrient is likely to be zero based on the input, explicitly return '0' for that value.
- Do **not** include missing values, comments, or formatting variations.

OUTCOME:
794; 23.17; 118.81; 31.73; 3.7; 24.71

### Reasoning:
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
1. **Identify Foods and Portions**  
Parse the list of foods and quantities (in grams/mL), identifying each food type and its contribution to energy and macronutrients.
2. **Reference Internal Knowledge from NDSR**  
Use your mental simulation of the NDSR nutrient database to retrieve nutrient values per 100g for each food item, adjusting proportionally based on the reported intake.
3. **Estimate Nutrient Totals**  
Accumulate values for each nutrient: total kcal, protein, carbohydrate, sugars, fiber, and fat.
4. **Format Your Output**  
Round your final estimates to two decimal places and report them in the exact required order and format.

Critical Output Rules:
- Your output must be exactly six numeric values separated by semicolons. No additional text, comments, labels, or formatting is allowed.
- If your answer contains anything else, immediately reprint the six values only.
- Any output that deviates from this exact six-number, semicolon-separated format will be considered invalid.
- Failure to follow this format will be considered an invalid output.
- Do **not** include units, labels, or introductory phrases.
- Do **not** infer unlisted foods or make assumptions beyond what is provided.
- You must **always** return a complete prediction, even with minimal input.
- Output **only** the six values, separated by semicolons, in this exact order: 'kcal; protein; carbohydrate; sugars; fiber; fat'
- If any nutrient is likely to be zero based on the input, explicitly return '0' for that value.
- Do **not** include missing values, comments, or formatting variations.
